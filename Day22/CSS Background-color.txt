CSS Background-color
This property is used to set the background color of an element. The background of an element covers the total size, including the padding and border and excluding margin. It can be applied to all HTML elements.

Syntax
element {  
    background-color: color_name|transparent|initial|inherit;  
}  
Let's discuss the possible values of this property.

color_name: It is used for defining the background color value or the color codes. It can be given by using the color name, hexadecimal value, or rgb() value.
transparent: It is the default value of this property, which is used to specify the transparent background-color.
initial: It is not used to set the background color. It sets the default value.
Inherit: It is used to inherit the background-color from its parent.
Let's see an illustration of this property.

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>   
<html>   
    <head>   
        <title>background-color property</title>   
        <style>    
            body {   
                text-align:center;   
                background-color: lightblue;          
            }   
         h1{  
            color: blue;  
         }  
        </style>    
    </head>   
    <body>    
       <h1>Hello World.</h1>  
        <h1>Welcome to the javaTpoint.com</h1>    
        </body>    
</html>  


CSS background-attachment property--

The background-attachment property is used to specify that the background image is fixed or scroll with the rest of the page in the browser window.

This property has three values scroll, fixed, and local. Its default value is scroll, which causes the element to not scroll with its content. The local value of this property causes the element to scroll with the content. If we set the value to fixed, the background image will not move during scrolling in the browser.

This CSS property can support multiple background images. We can specify a different value of the background-attachment property for each background-image, separated by commas. Every image will match with the corresponding value of this property.

Syntax
background-attachment: scroll | fixed | local | initial | inherit;  
The values of this property are defined as follows.

Property Values
scroll: It is the default value that prevents the element from scrolling with the contents, but scrolls with the page.

fixed: Using this value, the background image doesn't move with the element, even the element has a scrolling mechanism. It causes the image to be locked in one place, even the rest of the document scrolls.

local: Using this value, if the element has a scrolling mechanism, the background image scrolls with the content of the element.

initial: It sets the property to its default value.

inherit: It inherits the property from its parent element.

Let's understand this property by using some illustrations.

Example
In this example, we are using the scroll value of the background-attachment property, which is the default behavior. So when the page is scrolled, the background scrolls with it.

<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
<title>  
background-attachment property  
</title>  
  
<style>  
#example {  
background-image:  url("lion.png");  
font-size: 35px;  
border: 4px solid red;  
color: white;  
background-position: center;  
background-color: green;      
background-repeat: no-repeat;  
background-attachment: scroll;  
}  
  
</style>  
</head>  
  
<body>  
<h1> background-attachment: scroll;</h1>  
<p> If there is no scrollbar on your screen, then try to resize the browser's window to see the effect. </p>
