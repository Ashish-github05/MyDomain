CSS Outline--

CSS outline is just like CSS border property. It facilitates you to draw an extra border around an element to get visual attention.

It is as easy as to apply as a border.

See this example:

<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<style type="text/css">  
.box {  
        background-color: #eee;  
        outline: 3px solid red;  
        border: 3px solid lightgreen;  
        padding: 5px 10px;  
}  
</style>  
<div class="box">Welcome to JavaTpoint</div>  
</body>  
</html>

Difference between Border and Outline
At first glance, border and outline look similar, but there are some very important differences between them:

It is not possible to apply a different outline width, style and color for the four sides of an element while in border; 
you can apply the provided value for all four sides of an element.
The border is a part of element's dimension while the outline is not the part of element's dimension. 
Means, it doesn't matter how thick an outline you apply to the element, the dimensions of it won't change.
The outline property is a shorthand property. It can be divided into outline-width, outline-style and outline-color properties. 
It facilitates you to use any of the property alone, if you need it.

See this example:

<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<style type="text/css">  
.box {  
        background-color: #eee;  
        border: 3px solid Lightgreen;  
        padding: 5px 10px;  
        outline-width: 3px;  
        outline-style: solid;  
        outline-color: red;  
}  
</style>  
<div class="box">Welcome to JavaTpoint</div>  
</body>  
</html>

In the above example, you can see the three outline properties:

Outline-width:It is similar to margin and padding. It can be either an absolute value or a relative value or one of the predefined outline width values i.e. thin, medium or thick. It is preferred to use either an absolute value or a relative value because different browsers interpret differently while using predefined outline width values like thin, medium or thick.

Outline-color:It specifies the color that you use for the outline. It supports all the colors available in HTML and CSS.

Outline-style:In the above example, we have used only solid outline style while there are a lot of outline style i.e. hidden, dotted, dashed, solid, double, groove, ridge, inset and outset.

Let's take an example to demonstrate the usage of different outline-styles.

See this example:

<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<style type="text/css">  
.box {  
        outline-color: red;  
        outline-width: 4px;  
        margin: 10px;  
        float: left;  
        border: 2px solid lightgreen;  
        padding: 5px 10px;  
}  
</style>  
<div class="box" style="outline-style: dashed;">This is dashed outline.</div>  
<div class="box" style="outline-style: dotted;">This is dotted outline.</div>  
<div class="box" style="outline-style: double;">This is double outline.</div>  
<div class="box" style="outline-style: groove;">This is groove outline.</div>  
<div class="box" style="outline-style: inset;">This is inset outline.</div>  
<div class="box" style="outline-style: outset;">This is outset outline.</div>  
<div class="box" style="outline-style: ridge;">This is ridge outline.</div>  
<div class="box" style="outline-style: solid;">This is solid outline.</div>  
</body>  
</html>

Outline offset
The outline offset is used to create a distance between outline and border.

It takes a CSS length unit and the empty space between the border and the outline will be transparent and then it takes the background color of the parent element.
So you can see a visible difference between outline and border.

Let's take an example to see the difference between outline and border.

See this example:

<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<style type="text/css">  
.box {  
        background-color: #eee;  
        outline: 3px solid red;  
        outline-offset: 6px;  
        border: 3px solid Lightgreen;  
        padding: 5px 10px;  
}  
</style>  
<div class="box">Welcome to JavaTpoint</div>  
</body>
